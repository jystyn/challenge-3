Password Generator Challenge

For this assignment we had to creat a password generator with a series of prompts and confirmations. The password has to be between 8 and 128 characters. The user must aslo indicate if they want uppercase, lowercase, numbers, or special characters in their password. If the password isn't in the required range or the user did not select any of the character types, the user is alerted of this and the process is restarted.
